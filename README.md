Streamline your shipping operations by automating rate calculations, order creation, label generation, and returns—all from within the Medusa Admin.

**Compatible with Medusa v2.0+**

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1.  A **[Medusa v2](https://docs.medusajs.com/)** server set up.
2.  A **[Shiprocket](https://app.shiprocket.in/register)** account.
3.  At least one **Pickup Location** configured in your Shiprocket dashboard.

## 🛠️ Installation

Install the plugin using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install medusa-shiprocket-fulfillment-plugin
# or
yarn add medusa-shiprocket-fulfillment-plugin
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add your Shiprocket credentials to your `.env` file. 

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Note**: Never commit your actual API passwords to version control (git).

```bash
SHIPROCKET_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD="your_shiprocket_password"
# Must match the 'Nickname' of a pickup location in your Shiprocket settings
# This is also used to auto-fetch the pickup pincode for the delivery estimate API
SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_LOCATION="Primary"
```

### 2. Medusa Config

Register the plugin in your `medusa-config.js` (or `medusa-config.ts`) file. You need to add it to both the `modules` (for the fulfillment provider) and `plugins` (if you are using any admin widgets, though currently optional).

```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/fulfillment",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "medusa-shiprocket-fulfillment-plugin",
            id: "shiprocket",
            options: {
              email: process.env.SHIPROCKET_EMAIL,
              password: process.env.SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD,
              pickup_location: process.env.SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_LOCATION,
              /**
               * Set "true" (string) to enable Cash on Delivery support.
               * This maps the payment method 'cod' to Shiprocket's COD logic.
               */
              cod: "false", 
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Delivery Estimate API

Check serviceability and get estimated delivery dates for any pincode without creating an order.

**Endpoint:** `GET /store/shiprocket/delivery-estimate`

> [!NOTE]
> This endpoint is public — no API key required. Rate limited to **30 requests/min per IP**. Results are cached for **10 minutes**.

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `delivery_pincode` | ✅ Yes | The destination pincode (6 digits) |
| `pickup_pincode` | ❌ No | Pickup location pincode. If not provided, auto-fetched from `SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_LOCATION` |
| `weight` | ❌ No | Package weight in kg (defaults to 0.5) |
| `cod` | ❌ No | Cash on delivery: 0 or 1 (defaults to 0) |

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl "https://your-store.com/store/shiprocket/delivery-estimate?delivery_pincode=110001"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "serviceable": true,
  "fastest_delivery": {
    "courier_name": "Delhivery Surface",
    "courier_company_id": 21,
    "estimated_days": 2,
    "estimated_delivery_date": "2025-01-06",
    "rate": 45,
    "is_surface": true
  },
  "all_options": [...]
}
```

**Response Headers:**
| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Max requests per minute (30) |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining |
| `X-Cache` | `HIT` if cached, `MISS` if fresh |

> [!TIP]
> Set `SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_LOCATION` in your `.env` to auto-fetch the pickup pincode from your Shiprocket account. No need to pass `pickup_pincode` in every request!

## 💻 Usage Guide

### Enabling the Provider

1.  Log in to your **Medusa Admin**.
2.  Go to **Settings** → **Regions**.
3.  Select the region you want to ship to (e.g., "India").
4.  In the **Fulfillment Providers** section, edit and ensure `shiprocket` is selected.
5.  Save changes.

### Shipping Options

You can now create Shipping Options (e.g., "Standard Shipping") that use the **shiprocket** provider.
-   **Calculated**: Choose "Calculated" price type to use Shiprocket's real-time rate API.

### Creating a Fulfillment (Shipment)
When you fulfill an order in the Medusa Admin:
1.  The plugin creates an order in Shiprocket.
2.  It attempts to automatically assign an AWB (Air Waybill) using Shiprocket's "adhoc" API.
3.  If successful, the **Tracking Number** and **Tracking URL** are saved to the fulfillment in Medusa.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Rate calculation failed"
-   Ensure both the **Store Address** (Pickup) and **Customer Address** (Delivery) have valid 6-digit Indian pincodes.
-   Check that the `weight` is set on your Product Variants (in grams or per your Shiprocket config). Shiprocket requires weight to calculate rates.

### "Authentication failed"
-   Double-check your `SHIPROCKET_EMAIL` and `SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
-   The plugin auto-refreshes tokens, but invalid credentials will block this.
